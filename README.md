# The `__rc` Project
_Simplify maintaining your runtime configurations and setup across devices._

`__rc` uses a modular approach to
maintianing and using your .RC files. When I was a contractor I frequently had
to setup a new computer porting over my helper functions I created.

## Exports
**collections**
- functions
- aliases
- ps_config

 **Binaries**
- `sourceShellScripts` ....  used to read functions from functions folder

## Usage
source `.__rc/.bashrc` inside of your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# file: ~/.bashrc/

# We source the __rc file
[[ -f ~/.__rc/.bashrc ]] && source ~/.__rc/.bashrc
```
`
## Note

By convention the system will use a **login shell** (`.bash_profile`/`.profile`/`.zprofile`) when a user is using a
logged in session. When the user is not using a **login shell** the interactive shell is sourced.  (.bashrc, .zshrc)

It is recommended to source your interactive shell rc from the login rc. This
will keep session consistant between login and interactive sessions.

### Example
- `bash_profile` will source `.bashrc`
- `bashrc`, acting as a wrapper, will source `.__rc/bashrc`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# file: ~/.bash_profile/

# This source `.bashrc` from `.bash_profile`
[[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc
```

```
